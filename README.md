# raw-video-converter
 Small tool for ffmpeg I made that converts whatever file into a avi.
 It is recommended you add the bat into PATH.
 
 # Instructions
 type rawconvert (input) (output) (rgb5551/rgb5552/rgb32/rgb8)
rgb5552 will make a slightly slower version of the video and rgb32 will have more accurate results but it is also slow (10fps).
and rgb8 is basically rgb32 but it cant load icons/bitmaps and the data is slower.
