# raw-video-converter
 Small tool for ffmpeg I made that converts whatever file into a avi.
 It is recommended you add the bat into PATH.
 
 # Instructions
 type rawconvert (input) (output) (rgb5551/rgb5552/rgb32/rgb8/rgb24).
rgb5552 will make a slightly slower and larger resolution version of rgb5551 and rgb32 will have accurate results but it is also slow (10.766666 fps).
and rgb8 is basically rgb32 but it cant load icons/bitmaps and the data is slower.
and rgb24 is basically rgb32 but the audio is lower pitched and the pixels are more brighter.
